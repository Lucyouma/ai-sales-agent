# 🤖 AI Sales Agent  

## 🔖 Project Title & Description  
**AI Sales Agent: Lead Qualification & Appointment Setter**  

This project is an AI-powered sales assistant designed for **CEOs, founders, and sales teams** who face challenges with:  
- Unqualified leads clogging their CRM  
- Time wasted on manual outreach  
- Missed opportunities from cold leads  

The **AI Sales Agent** automatically:  
- Connects to a lead database/CRM  
- **Scores and qualifies leads** based on predefined business rules (budget, company size, engagement history)  
- Enriches missing data using AI (e.g., analyzing company websites or past interactions)  
- Generates **personalized outreach messages** for cold leads  
- Schedules appointments with high-value prospects  

**Why it matters**: Sales teams can focus on closing deals while the AI handles lead filtering, nurturing, and booking. This directly saves time, cuts costs, and accelerates revenue growth.

## 🧠 AI Integration Strategy  

### 🔹 Code Generation  
- Use AI agents in the IDE (Cursor/Zed) to scaffold features such as:  
  - API endpoints (`/leads/qualify`, `/leads/book`)  
  - React components for the dashboard (Lead Table, Outreach Preview)  
  - Database schema migrations (Leads table with fields: `id, name, email, company, revenue, score, status`)  
- **Example Prompt**:  
  > “Generate an Express.js route to fetch unqualified leads from Supabase, run them through GPT-4 scoring logic, and return ranked results.”  

---

### 🔹 Testing  
- AI will assist in writing **unit tests** for core functions (e.g., `qualifyLead`, `generateOutreachEmail`) and **integration tests** for workflows (lead intake → qualification → booking).  
- Jest will be used for running tests.  
- **Example Prompt**:  
  > “Write a Jest test suite for the `qualifyLead` function to cover valid inputs, missing fields, and invalid data scenarios.”  

---

### 🔹 Documentation  
- AI will generate **docstrings** for functions, ensuring clarity of parameters and return values.  
- Inline comments for complex logic will be auto-suggested using AI completions.  
- This **README.md** and future setup guides will be co-authored with AI to ensure consistency and readability.  

---

### 🔹 Context-Aware Techniques  
- **Schema-Aware**: Feed the `Leads` database schema into AI prompts to generate SQL queries, validation rules, and CRUD operations.  
- **API-Aware**: Provide OpenAPI/Swagger specs to AI so it can auto-generate handlers, validation, and error responses.  
- **File Tree/Diff Reviews**: During PRs, paste file trees and diffs into the AI for suggestions on refactoring, security, and performance improvements.  
- **Example Prompt**:  
  > “Review this PR diff for potential security issues. Suggest improvements for SQL query safety and error handling.”
